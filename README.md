# FLAPPY BIRD — PA0
    A Programming Assignment by Anthony Torres

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to PA0!
This programming assignment introduces students to basic game development concepts through a recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Pygame. The goal of this assignment is to help students become comfortable reading existing code, understanding game logic, and making small but meaningful modifications.

## 🎮 Program Description
This program is a simple recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game built using Pygame. The player controls a bird that flaps upward when the space bar is pressed and is constantly pulled downward by gravity. The objective is to navigate the bird through gaps between moving pipes while avoiding collisions with the pipes or the screen boundaries.

The project is designed as an introductory programming assignment (PA0). Most of the core game logic is already implemented, and students are guided through the code with TODO comments that focus on adjusting physics values, fixing gameplay mechanics, implementing scoring, and making small visual changes. This assignment emphasizes understanding existing code rather than writing large amounts of new code.
